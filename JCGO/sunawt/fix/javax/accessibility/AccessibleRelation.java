/**
 * <P>Class AccessibleRelation describes a relation between the
 * object that implements the AccessibleRelation and one or more other
 * objects.  The actual relations that an object has with other
 * objects are defined as an AccessibleRelationSet, which is a composed
 * set of AccessibleRelations.
 * <p>The toDisplayString method allows you to obtain the localized string
 * for a locale independent key from a predefined ResourceBundle for the
 * keys defined in this class.
 * <p>The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration
 * of common object roles. If the constants in this class are not sufficient
 * to describe the role of an object, a subclass should be generated
 * from this class and it should provide constants in a similar manner.
